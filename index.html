This research aims to develop open-source software managed by a select group of hardware design engineering graduate students at Berkeley EECS. Applying my SoC and Sky130 PDK knowledge gained from EECS151 and analog circuit design skills from EE140, I have actively participated in designing the layout and schematic generators, measurement managers, and design scripts using Python and C++. I am excited about implementing algorithms to aid analog circuit designers in optimizing sizing and reducing their simulation time, thus enhancing their work efficiency. </li>

				Recognizing the need for a thriving ECE community, I co-founded the ECE student association at NTUST. The association had lost its prominence due to previous mismanagement, leading to limited participation in departmental events, including sports competitions. Passionate about both engineering and fitness, I viewed this as an opportunity to not only revitalize the association but also to demonstrate my leadership capabilities, revitalizing it within a year to become an active part of the department. This effort not only enhanced departmental participation but also showcased my leadership capabilities, demonstrating success in managing a team and overcoming challenges.
